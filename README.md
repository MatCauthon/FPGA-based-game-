# FPGA-based-game-
Code is all on FPGA, you need a monitor(VGA) and a keyboard to play the game 
Cooperated with two friends during 2016.06-2016.08 to finish this game.
It is basically a puzzle, you control a unit's movement, avoid enemies and go to the destination.
Fun thing is cheat code is included.
